# Cashier Quick‑Start Guide

Welcome to the POS system!  This short guide explains how to perform a typical sale using the cashier
interface.  The UI is designed to be keyboard‑first with optional touch support.

## Logging in

1. Launch the POS application and log in with your username and password.
2. If prompted, enter your PIN to unlock cashier functions.

## Performing a sale

1. **Start scanning** – Focus the “Scan” input field.  When you scan a barcode with your USB
   scanner, the item will be added to the cart automatically.  You can also type a SKU or search term
   and press **Enter** to add an item.
2. **Adjust quantity** – After an item is added, press **F2** to open the quantity dialog.  Enter
   the desired quantity and press **Enter**.
3. **Apply discount** – Press **F3** to open the discount dialog.  Enter a percentage or rupee amount.
   Manager approval may be required for large discounts.
4. **Hold cart** – Press **F4** to place the current cart on hold (e.g. when the customer fetches
   another item).  The cart is saved and can be resumed from the Holds list.
5. **Checkout** – Press **F5** or click the “Pay” button.  Choose the payment method(s) and enter
   the amounts.  The system supports cash, cards, UPI (via QR or intent) and wallets; you can split the
   total across multiple tenders.
6. **Print receipt** – After payment is captured the receipt prints automatically.  You can reprint
   it by pressing **F9** and entering the receipt number.
7. **New sale** – A new cart starts automatically after a completed sale.  The totals from the previous
   sale are summarised in the Daily Z report.

## Returns & Exchanges

1. Press **F6** to open the **Returns** screen.
2. Scan or enter the receipt number to find the original sale.
3. Select the items and quantities to return.  Enter a reason code (e.g. Damaged, Wrong item).  Manager
   PIN may be required.
4. Choose the refund method.  Refunds can be processed back to the original tender or issued as store
   credit.
5. A return receipt is printed and stock is updated.
